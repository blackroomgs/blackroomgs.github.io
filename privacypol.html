<p class=MsoNormal><b>Terms & Conditions</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>By downloading or using the app, these terms will
automatically apply to you - you should make sure therefore that you read them
carefully before using the app. You`re not allowed to copy or modify the app,
any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way. You`re not allowed to
attempt to extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn`t try to
translate the app into other languages or make derivative versions. The app
itself, and all the trademarks, copyright, database rights, and other
intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to BlackRoom Game
Studio.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>BlackRoom Game Studio is committed to ensuring that the
app is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the
right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and
for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services without making
it very clear to you exactly what you`re paying for.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Power Loom 3D app stores and processes
personal data that you have provided to us, to provide our Service.
It`s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We
therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the
process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the
official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable
to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone`s security
features and it could mean that the Power Loom 3D app won`t work
properly or at all.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The app does use third-party services that declare their
Terms and Conditions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Link to Terms and Conditions of third-party service providers
used by the app</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>

     Play Services</a></li>

</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>You should be aware that there are certain things
that BlackRoom Game Studio will not take responsibility for. Certain
functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet
connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network
provider, but BlackRoom Game Studio cannot take responsibility for
the app not working at full functionality if you don`t have access to Wi-Fi,
and you don`t have any of your data allowance left.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you`re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you
should remember that the terms of the agreement with your mobile network
provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile
provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while
accessing the app, or other third-party charges. In using the app, you`re
accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges
if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country)
without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device
on which you`re using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have
received permission from the bill payer for using the app.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Along the same lines, BlackRoom Game Studio cannot
always take responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to make
sure that your device stays charged - if it runs out of battery and you can`t
turn it on to avail the Service, BlackRoom Game Studio cannot accept
responsibility.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With respect to BlackRoom Game Studio`s responsibility
for your use of the app, when you`re using the app, it`s important to bear in
mind that although we endeavor to ensure that it is updated and correct at all
times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can
make it available to you. BlackRoom Game Studio accepts no liability for
any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on
this functionality of the app.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is
currently available on Android and the requirements for
the system (and for any additional systems we decide to extend the
availability of the app to) may change, and you`ll need to download the updates
if you want to keep using the app. BlackRoom Game Studio does not
promise that it will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or
works with the Android version that you have installed on your
device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when
offered to you, We may also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate
use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we
tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted
to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if
needed) delete it from your device.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Changes to This Terms and Conditions</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We may update our Terms and Conditions from time to
time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any
changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms and
Conditions on this page.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These terms and conditions are effective as
of 2023-01-01</p>
